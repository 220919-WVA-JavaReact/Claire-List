#email uniqueness-checking "middleware" :-)
#I check to see if the email is being used by another user on account creation 
#(handled, appending-users.sh)

#step one: read through the contents of our data
grep <expression to match> mock-data.csv

#step two: use regex to check for matching email address
if(match)
reject;
#on true match, reject user input
elif(!match)
next()
#on !match, resume execution (where is next() when you need her???)
